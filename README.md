# Empirical-Study-of-Adversarial-Attacks-on-ESC-
This Repository can be used to perform analysis of an impact of adversarial attacks on environmental sound classification systems. An empirical study is performed with the seven state-of-the-art deep models (AlexNet, DenseNet, VGG-16, ResNet-101, Resnet-50, ResNet-34, ResNet-18). 
The empirical study includes analysis of fooling rate, transferability of adversarial examples and L2 peturbation distance as a measure to create an adversarial example from a clean example. This study is performed on three benchmark ESC datasets: ESC-10, Urban Sound 8K and DCASE 2019 Challenge Task-1(A).
